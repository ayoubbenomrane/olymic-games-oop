# 🏅 Olympic Games Tournament Manager (C++ OOP Project)

A C++ object-oriented programming project that simulates the organization and management of Olympic Games events. It supports both individual and team events, with extensible features for scheduling, scoring, and medal tracking.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Demonstrate strong OOP principles (abstraction, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism)
- Design a modular, extensible system to simulate Olympic competitions
- Support both **individual** and **team-based** events
- Lay the foundation for additional features like scheduling, result processing, and statistics
